      <description>Note : This is part three of a series of posts describing how to write &amp;ldquo;Production Grade Webservice in Go&amp;rdquo;. Here&amp;rsquo;s Part - 1, The Service  and Part - 2 The Store  if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read those.
We&amp;rsquo;ve reached a point where we have properly laid out the business logic and the storage implementation for our service. Now, we&amp;rsquo;re going to move on and talk about transports. As the name suggests, a transport is essentially transporting data over the network in a pre-defined format.</description>

The previous post ended with a defined structured for our service and some basic testing. It was, however, lacking what is a very important component for most webservices, a datastore. If you&amp;rsquo;ve used frameworks to write services in the past, you&amp;rsquo;re probably familiar with abstractions like Hibernate/DjangoORM etc.</description>

      <description>Production Grade is a term thrown around a lot these days. Every organization seems to have it&amp;rsquo;s own definition for what qualifies as &amp;ldquo;Production Grade&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Production Ready&amp;rdquo;. In these series of posts, I&amp;rsquo;m going to present my take on the topic and the bare minimum of what I think qualifies under this definition. These posts assume a working knowledge of Go and are not meant for total beginners to the language.</description>
