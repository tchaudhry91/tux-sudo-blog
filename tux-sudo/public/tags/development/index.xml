      <description>So, I&#39;ve recently had to work with the Azure-SDK for a few small tasks. I&#39;ve worked with AWS and GCP SDKs before, and while they have their problems it wasn&#39;t too hard to figure them out. Azure wasn&#39;t quite the same.
Now, I am new to Azure, but I did not expect to spend 30 minutes to get a simple VM listing to work. The Authentication docs seemed fairly straight forward.</description>
