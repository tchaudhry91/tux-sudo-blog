      <description>Code Coverage, Static Code Analysis, Tests, Releases? What else? Probably a few more things, but you get the point. These are all things that are expected to be part of a modern day development workflow. While this is becoming the norm in companies, a lot of pet open-source projects still skimp on these things. And frankly, I did too. I wasn&#39;t going to bother hosting my own Jenkins behemoth just so my soon-to-be abandoned project could run a few builds.</description>

      <description>One thing has always bothered me while writing tests is the lack of a real datasource to run tests against. Most projects I&#39;ve worked with in the past have either mocked responses from a datastore or used a &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; datastore to perform tests against. While mocks are good for quick unit tests, I still prefer using a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; datasource, especially for integration tests.
While taking Bill Kennedy&#39;s Ultimate Go training a while ago, I saw Bill recommend a testing approach which involved &amp;ldquo;spinning up&amp;rdquo; a database container right from within your test code, run your tests, and clean-up.</description>
