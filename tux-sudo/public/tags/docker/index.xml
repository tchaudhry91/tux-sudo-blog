      <description>One thing has always bothered me while writing tests is the lack of a real datasource to run tests against. Most projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with in the past have either mocked responses from a datastore or used a &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; datastore to perform tests against. While mocks are good for quick unit tests, I still prefer using a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; datasource, especially for integration tests.
While taking Bill Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s Ultimate Go training a while ago, I saw Bill recommend a testing approach which involved &amp;ldquo;spinning up&amp;rdquo; a database container right from within your test code, run your tests, and clean-up.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So then, here is the deal. I write tiny microservices that may or may not serve any purpose. Despite how meaningless they might be, I give them the perfect operations treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This one is a gamechanger. It really is.
On a recent Golang obsessed Github browsing spree, I read the following project description: &amp;ldquo;Fast, cross-platform HTTP/2 web server with automatic HTTPS&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve read that before, and more often than not ended up disappointing myself and resorting to hacks like [this] (https://blog.tux-sudo.com/posts/letsencrypt-nginx-docker/) to create an automatic TLS system for my websites. There are other ways, but almost all of them were semi-automatic in the long run (yay cron!</description>

      <title>LetsEncrypt Certificates for Dockerized Nginx</title>

      <description>I like nginx. I like docker. I like SSL. I also like not paying for SSL certificates.If you, like me are operating a small time website, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to dish out a few hundred dollars for an SSL certificate.Thankfully, LetsEncrypt provides free ssl certificates and is now trusted by most major browsers.However, integrating certbot to automatically configure my nginx inside a docker container has been a pain. In the past, I generated the standalone cert with &amp;ndash;cert-only and then linked my docker container to use it but this was a far from usable solution given the horrid automation code I had to write.</description>
